# 🍄 Mycel

> *Like mycelium — no hierarchy, just connections.*

A lean, Temporal-native AI assistant that grows a living knowledge network from every conversation.

---

🌱 **Always growing.** Every chat feeds a knowledge graph that links, strengthens, and never forgets.

🔁 **Self-healing.** Errors come with explanations and options, not dead ends. Temporal retries the rest.

🤝 **Keeps its word.** Every promise becomes a durable workflow. It literally can't forget.

🧠 **Right brain, right job.** An org of models — interns handle busywork, seniors think, executives only when it matters. ~$0.70/day, not $4.50.

🔬 **Yours to own.** Small codebase. Your code. Change how it thinks, what it remembers, how it works.
