# Mycel

A lean, Temporal-native AI assistant that grows a living knowledge network from every conversation. Like mycelium — no hierarchy, just connections.

**Self-healing.** Errors come with explanations and fix options, not dead ends.
**Never forgets.** Every promise becomes a durable workflow with a timer.
**Always learning.** A living knowledge graph grows from every conversation.
**Cost-effective.** An organization of models — interns do busywork, executives only for hard problems.
