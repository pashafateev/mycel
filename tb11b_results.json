The reported metrics for TB5 were precision 0.588, recall 0.476, and top-3 retrieval hit rate 0.417, all of which were below desired reliability for production behavior. Additionally, there were noted operational reliability issues, including `Mem0 add()` sometimes returning empty results, recurring SQLite thread errors, and provider-specific issues in `mem0ai 1.0.4`.

      "senior_answer": "Based on the provided context, there is **not enough information to estimate how long Phase 1 will take.**\n\nHere's why:\n*   The context mentions \"Mycel has remaining TB4/TB9/TB10 and consolidation before Phase 1 build,\" but it does not provide any time estimates for completing these remaining tasks.\n*   It also states that a \"stable internal MVP estimated at 2-3 weeks if scoped reliability-first,\" but this is for an MVP, not necessarily the full Phase 1, and it doesn't account for the pre-Phase 1 work.\n*   While your work schedule is mentioned, there's no information on how much time you can dedicate to this project per week, which is crucial for an estimate.",
      "verify_reason": "The intern's answer states they cannot estimate Phase 1 duration, which is incorrect. The context explicitly states 'Stable internal MVP estimated at 2-3 weeks if scoped reliability-first.' This directly provides an estimate for a significant part of Phase 1 (MVP). The intern incorrectly interprets 'MVP' as distinct from 'Phase 1' in a way that prevents estimation, when in fact, the MVP is a core component of Phase 1. The expected answer correctly synthesizes this information with the user's work schedule and remaining work to provide a comprehensive estimate.",
      "judge_intern_reason": "The candidate answer states it cannot estimate how long Phase 1 will take, but the context provides a direct estimate for a 'stable internal MVP' of Mycel at 2-3 weeks, which is synonymous with Phase 1 in this context. The candidate correctly identifies the remaining work but fails to connect the MVP estimate to Phase 1.",
      "judge_senior_reason": "The candidate answer states there is not enough information, but the context provides sufficient details to form a reasonable estimate. The `mycel-deep-dive.md` explicitly states '~1 week MVP is likely aggressive. Stable internal MVP estimated at 2-3 weeks if scoped reliability-first.' This directly addresses the time for an MVP, which is a subset of Phase 1. The `TRACER-BULLET-RESULTS.md` and `PROJECTS.md` highlight remaining work (production deltas, TB4/TB9/TB10, consolidation) that would push the estimate beyond 1 week, aligning with the 2-3 week estimate for a *stable* MVP. The user's full-time job also reinforces the need for a realistic, not aggressive, timeline. The expected answer synthesizes these points to provide a coherent estimate.",
