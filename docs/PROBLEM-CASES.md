## pc-cron-besteffort-001: Cron delivery fails silently under bestEffort

- Created: `2026-02-22T00:00:00Z`
- Severity: `high`
- Tags: `temporal`, `cron`, `reliability`

### Context
Scheduled workflows use bestEffort style delivery and can mask dropped notifications.

### User Ask
Send my 8am briefing every weekday and tell me if delivery failed.

### Observed Bad
No briefing arrives and no explicit failure signal reaches the user.

### Expected Good
Missed or failed deliveries are surfaced with retry state and a user-visible alert path.

## pc-mem0-negation-001: Mem0 stores the opposite of user intent on negation

- Created: `2026-02-22T00:00:00Z`
- Severity: `high`
- Tags: `memory`, `mem0`, `quality`

### Context
Auto-memory extraction can misread negations and conditional statements.

### User Ask
Remember that I do not want daily digests unless I explicitly re-enable them.

### Observed Bad
Memory writes 'user wants daily digests' and future behavior violates preference.

### Expected Good
Memory parser preserves negation/conditional scope and confidence-gates uncertain writes.

### Notes
Especially frequent with patterns like 'unless', 'except', and double negatives.

## pc-model-switching-001: Manual model switching interrupts flow

- Created: `2026-02-22T00:00:00Z`
- Severity: `med`
- Tags: `routing`, `ux`

### Context
Mycel runs a model org, but users still need to override model picks during mixed-complexity chats.

### User Ask
Handle quick admin edits and then deep planning in one thread without me babysitting model choice.

### Observed Bad
User repeatedly toggles models; cheap model handles hard turn and quality drops.

### Expected Good
Router escalates automatically per turn and keeps user out of manual model selection loops.

## pc-post-merge-branch-001: Follow-up fix committed to already-merged branch

- Created: `2026-02-22T00:00:00Z`
- Severity: `med`
- Tags: `process`, `reliability`

### Context
A PR branch was merged to main, then additional commits were added to the same branch and assumed to be included in main.

### User Ask
Once I merge it should be good.

### Observed Bad
Assistant says merging will make it good, but commits were added after the merge so main did not get them.

### Expected Good
After a PR is merged, follow-ups must land via a new PR (or confirm main contains the new commit SHA). Provide a link to the follow-up PR and verify content on main.

### Notes
Fix: open a new PR or re-open PR; verify via gh api that main includes expected SHA.

## pc-research-drop-001: Research results not surfaced to user

- Created: `2026-02-22T00:00:00Z`
- Severity: `med`
- Tags: `process`, `ux`, `reliability`

### Context
We ran research (memory systems survey, claude-mem analysis) but user could not find/recall the outputs.

### User Ask
What happened to the research on the memory options out there?

### Observed Bad
Research exists but is not summarized/linked proactively; user experiences it as dropped.

### Expected Good
Whenever research completes, summarize key conclusions and link artifacts; keep a tracked index of reports.

### Notes
Mention artifacts: /tmp/llm-memory-systems-survey.md, /tmp/claude-mem-analysis.md, /tmp/mycel-memory-research.md.
